## LYRICS

He rode out of town  
Hellbound  
Like a whirlwind blowing around  
Mama prays  
Each Day  
On a prodigal son she waits  
For the Lord to bring him home  
And she prays  
Dear Lord bring him home  
&nbsp;  
And somewhere tonight a dying candlelight burns thin  
Mama begs for mercy, "Lord don't forget my kin."  
She lives with the fear that she won't live to see him change  
We all lost faith  
Still mama prays  
&nbsp;  
Angels heaven sent  
Descend  
They whisper to him now and again  
But he hides  
From the right  
That mama taught him all of his life  
So far from home  
And she prays  
Dear Lord bring him home  
&nbsp;  
And somewhere tonight a dying candlelight burns thin  
Mama begs for mercy, "Lord don't forget my kin."  
She lives with the fear that she won't live to see him change  
We all lost faith  
Still mama prays  
&nbsp;  
He rode all night through sleet and snow  
Arrived right after the good Lord called her home  
Her body lies but her spirit's free  
The tears fall and he hits his knees  
&nbsp;  
Somewhere tonight a dying candlelight burns thin  
He begs for mercy Lord please forgive my sins  
He lives with the fear that he's not strong enough to change  
But somewhere from a distance place  
Lord please send him grace  
Still mama prays  
Still mama prays  
&nbsp;  
An angel heaven sent  
Descends  
She whispers to him now and again  
Dear Lord bring him home
