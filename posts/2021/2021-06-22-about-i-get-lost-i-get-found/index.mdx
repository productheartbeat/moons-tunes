## About I Get Lost I Get Found

I got the initial inspiration for I get Lost I get Found from the Lynard Skynard song, "Was I right or wrong."  

The lyrics go:  
First I got lost, then I got found  
But the ones that I love are in the ground  
Somebody tell me please was I right or wrong  

Obviously that was sung by Ronnie Van Zant and the song is about living the dream: money, girls, cars, long cigars. But it also questions, is that what it's really all about.  

Was I right or wrong  
I got lost I got found  

Reminds me of the scripture in Mark chapter 9. A desperate father sought out Jesus to cast a demon out of his son.  

Jesus then tells this man one of the more famous scriptures: "All things are possible to him that believeth."  

The father then says, "Lord I believe. Help thou mine unbelief."  

I feel like I'm constantly caught between belief and unbelief, questioning if I'm right or wrong, and bouncing back and forth between getting lost and getting found.
