## LYRICS

Lyrics
=====
You tell me through the bible  
You say you want to speak with me tonight  
You tell me to reveal what's deep inside  
My stubborn heart these dead end thoughts  
The regret of all that's lost  
Oh Lord, I'm sure you've heard it all a million times  
Somewhere along the line I went astray  
Now standing in the darkness, show me the way  
&nbsp;  
'Cause I stepped off  
The straight and narrow  
I put my heart  
In the devil's hands  
And I forgot  
Which voice to follow  
But with a little help from thee oh, Lord  
I'll get back on the path  
&nbsp;  
I never thought I'd falter  
I never thought I'd drift this far away  
I don't know how to make it all okay  
But I have a broken heart willing to change  
So if you can hear me, I'll start today  
&nbsp;  
'Cause I stepped off  
The straight and narrow  
I put my heart  
In the devil's hands  
And I forgot  
Which voice to follow  
But with a little help from thee oh, Lord  
I'll get back on the path  
&nbsp;  
This burning in my heart  
This stillness in my soul  
An answer to my prayer, Lord  
Tells me to let it go  
I want to let it go  
&nbsp;  
'Cause I stepped off  
The straight and narrow  
I put my heart  
In the devil's hands  
And I forgot  
Which voice to follow  
But with a little help from thee oh, Lord  
With a little help from thee oh, Lord  
With a little help from thee oh, Lord  
I'll get back on the path
