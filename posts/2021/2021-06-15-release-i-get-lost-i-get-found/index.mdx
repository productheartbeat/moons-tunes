## LYRICS

I know where I'm going and I know where I've been  
But I forget what's in between every now and then  
I get lost I get found  
  
I know good from evil and I know all my sins  
But I can't tell my enemies from my friends  
I get lost I get found  

I get lost I get found  
In this mean world I'm tossed around  
I climb up and tumble down  
I get lost and I get found  

I know how the world began and I know how it ends  
But I wonder where I'll be when Jesus comes again  
I get lost I get found  

I get lost I get found  
In this mean world I'm tossed around  
I climb up and tumble down  
I get lost and I get found  

I know all the signs and I see all the trends  
But I can't answer who, what, why, how, where, or when  
I get lost I get found  

I get lost I get found  
In this mean world I'm tossed around  
I climb up and tumble down  

I get lost I get found  
In this mean world I'm tossed around  
I climb up and tumble down  
I get lost and I get found
